Must Use PR templates according to your requirement.

💻Code PRs
Currently, we only cover problems of LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks and InterviewBit. Problems of other good platforms can be accepted(ONLY AFTER DISCUSSIONS).
We maintain the structure of repositroy by creating specific directories corresponding to coding platoforms i.e. Leetcode, GFG, Interviewbit.
⚠️Please contribute your code in the right directory!! Example - LeetCode questions should be in the LeetCode directory and same for others.
LeetHub users, only you can upload your code in the main directory from now.(when using extension)
MUST CHECK if that question already exists or not!! Follow following steps:
Example- A solution named "Nine divisors.java" is to be added, then first check if any directory(or new PR) with the name "Nine divisors" exists or not and if yes, then move to "Nine divisors" directory and then add your code there(if java file exists then append in that file) or if that folder doesn't exists then create a folder/directory with the name "Nine divisors" and then add your code. How to create a folder/directory?
File naming convention:
Every word in the file should be separated by a space. eg. "Rat in the maze" , "19. Remove Nth Node From End of List", etc.
❌No other naming format will be accepted from now.(to maintian the structure)
Do not use "/" in the name of any file!(this will leads to creating a directory)
We strictly avoid removing the code of other contributors.
Migration PRs
Help us structure this repository.

Select a code file from the main/home directory that was not contributed by LeetHub extension.
Add it to the directory of their corresponding coding platform(with a folder name of that problem). Eg. "Nine divisors.java" file should be in the directory "GFG/Nine divisors".
Delete that file from the home directory.
❌Note: Creating multiple wrong PRs can lead to a permanent ban.❌
